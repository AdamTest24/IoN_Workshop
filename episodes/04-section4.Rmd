## Introduction to Networks

We will build and represent a network in Python using __NetworkX__ package.

NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

To use NetworkX and visualise your networks, you can import the whole package.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(reticulate)
use_python("/Users/sabaferdous/envL2D/bin/python3")
#use_virtualenv("r-env")
```

```{python}
import networkx as nx
```

### **Nodes and Edges**

Nodes are the basic units of networks. They are linked to other nodes by edges, which show the way(s) in which the nodes are connected or related. In principle, any object, person, cell or brain region can be a node.

The goal of network science is to obtain a representation of connections or interactions between nodes using graphs. 

Letâ€™s start by creating an empty graph object and then add some nodes to it.

```{python}
firstGraph = nx.Graph()

firstGraph.add_node('Node A')
firstGraph.add_node('Node B')
firstGraph.add_node('Node C')

print(firstGraph.nodes)
```

We have created a graph called firstGraph, added three nodes, and then printed a list of the nodes in this graph. So far, these nodes have no relationship to each other. To specify relationships (representing e.g. interactions) we can add edges to show how the nodes are connected.

```{python}
firstGraph.add_edge('Node A', 'Node B')
firstGraph.add_edge('Node A', 'Node C')
firstGraph.add_edge('Node B', 'Node C')

print(firstGraph.edges)
```

Here we created edges between Nodes A and B, A and C, and B and C, and printed a list of these edges. We can also get a summary of how many nodes and edges our graph currently has. At this stage, our graph should have three nodes and three edges. Here is how to check that in NetworkX.

### **Visualising networks**

Having basic graph called firstGraph, we can visualise it. In NetworkX, we can use function `draw_networkx`.

```{python}
nx.draw_networkx(firstGraph)
```

To change the size and the colour of the node symbols:

```{python}
nx.draw_networkx(firstGraph, node_size=2000, node_color='r')
```

### **Complex Networks**

Here is an example of function that creates a fully connected network: all possible edges between the nodes are realised.

```{python}
nodes = 10

Graph = nx.complete_graph(nodes)

layout = nx.circular_layout(Graph)

nx.draw_networkx(Graph, pos=layout)
```

And here is network where connections are drawn randomly but with a pre-defined probability, a random network.

```{python}
edge_probability = 0.5

ER = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(nodes, edge_probability, seed=123)

layout = nx.spring_layout(ER)

nx.draw_networkx(ER, pos=layout)
```

Change the probability and see how the network changes.

```{python}
edge_probability = 0.1

ER = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(nodes, edge_probability, seed=123)

layout = nx.spring_layout(ER)

nx.draw_networkx(ER, pos=layout)
```

## The C. elegans Neuron Network

We have a look at the structural network of C. elegans.

[Introduction to C elegans neurons](http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_celegansintro/celegansintro.html#sec5.4)

[C elegans neurons in the worm atlas](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/nervous/Neuroframeset.html)

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a nematode used as model organism to study developmental biology, and specifically neuronal development. It is one of the simplest organisms with a nervous system, which makes it particularly suited for this research. The complete connectome (neuronal map) has been published, originally by White, Southgate, Thomson, and Brenner in 1986, and continues to be researched. 
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In this section we are going to use some simplified data from the Dynamic Connectome lab on the neuronal networks of C. elegans. For simplicity, these data have been edited such that only the first 50 of the 131 documented neurons are included. The Python Pandas library is used to import this data. 
</p>

To analyse and display the neural network of C. elegans, we take neurons to represent __nodes__ and synapses to represent __edges__ of a network. 

### **Import Connectivity Data and Labels**
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The information in the form of a so-called network or connectivity matrix. The matrix shows how neurons connect to each other. We import the connectivity matrix from the file 'celegans131matrix_50.csv'. It can be conveniently displayed using `imshow()`. If we check its length using `len()`, we can find out how many neurons it represents. 
</p>

```{python}
from pandas import read_csv

data = read_csv('data/celegans131matrix_50.csv', header=None, dtype = "int")

neurons = data.to_numpy()

len(neurons)
```

To display the matrix, we can use the function `imshow()`.

```{python}
from matplotlib.pyplot import subplots, show

fig, ax = subplots()

im = ax.imshow(neurons);

fig.colorbar(im, ticks=(0, 1));

show()
```

Each yellow square (representing "1") indicates a connection from the neuron with the index in the rows to a neuron with the index in the columns. 
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Next, we import the labels and convert the resulting dataframe into a dictionary using function `to_dict`. This is a complex Python array, where the index of each neuron is associated with the name of it. The function `to_dict` wraps the dictionary within a dictionary and therefore indexing is used to access the `inner` dict.
</p>

```{python}
neuron_Names = read_csv('data/celegans131labels_50.csv', header=None)

neuronNames = neuron_Names.to_dict()

neuronLabels = neuronNames[0]

print(neuronLabels)

```

### **C. elegans Network Display**

The connectivity matrix can directly be converted to a Networkx graph.

- First, a Graph object is created, `neuronGraph`

- Second, a network layout is specifided, `neurinLayout`

- Third, the network is plotted with function`draw_networkx`

```{python}
neuronGraph  = nx.from_numpy_matrix(neurons, 
                                    create_using=nx.DiGraph)   

neuronLayout = nx.random_layout(neuronGraph, seed=12)

nx.draw_networkx(neuronGraph, neuronLayout, 
        node_size=1000,
        labels=neuronLabels)
        
show()        
```

The network can be displayed in different layouts, for instance circular:

```{python}
neuronGraph  = nx.from_numpy_matrix(neurons, 
                                    create_using=nx.DiGraph)   

neuronLayout = nx.circular_layout(neuronGraph)

nx.draw_networkx(neuronGraph, neuronLayout, 
        node_size=1000,
        labels=neuronLabels)
show()        
```

### **Quantitative Analysis**
Quantitative analysis of the network is possible. For instance, we can plot the number of connections that each neuron has:

```{python}

fig, ax = subplots()

ax.plot(dict(neuronGraph.degree).values(), '-o');
ax.set_xlabel('Index');
ax.set_ylabel('Degree');

show()
```


## Anatomical Mapping
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
File `celegans131positions_50.csv` contains information on how the nodes relate to each other in 2-D space. Because in neuroscience, the spatial position in an organism or in the brain is crucial for interpretation, we can include positional information to replace the arbitrary layout.
</p>

```{python}
neuronPos = read_csv('data/celegans131positions_50.csv', header=None)

neuronPos.items
```

```{python}
nx.draw_networkx(neuronGraph, neuronPos.values,
        node_size=1000,
        labels=neuronLabels)
show()
```


```{python}
new_pos = neuronPos.copy()
new_pos.values[:, 0] = -1*neuronPos.values[:, 0]

nx.draw_networkx(neuronGraph, new_pos.values,
        node_size=1000,
        labels=neuronLabels)
show()        
```

The two BAG nodes to the right of the display are the [sensory neurons used to monitor oxygen and carbon dioxide](https://www.wormatlas.org/neurons/Individual%20Neurons/BAGframeset.html).

Here is some background:
[BAG genes, functions and connections](http://wormweb.org/neuralnet#c=BAG&m=1)

The graph display is in Matplotlib and can be handled as such. E.g. for possible Node shapes see:
https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/markers_api.html#module-matplotlib.markers. 

If you have a multi-panel figure, specify the axes for the network with keyword argument `ax`:

```{python}
fig, ax = subplots(figsize=(14, 8), ncols=2)

nx.draw_networkx(neuronGraph, neuronLayout, 
        node_size=1000,
        labels=neuronLabels,
        ax=ax[0])

nx.draw_networkx(neuronGraph, neuronPos.values,
        node_shape='H',
        node_color='tomato',
        node_size=1300,
        labels=neuronLabels,
        ax=ax[1])

ax[0].set_title('Circular view of C elegans network');
ax[1].set_title('Anatomical view of C elegans network');

show()
```
